# Credit Card Autocomplete
Testing the autocomplete attributes for Credit Cards stored in the web browser.

Built to figure out how to get a 2 digit year into a field, when Chrome was sending 4 digits, and the last 2 were being truncated. "2024" -> "20", not "24" as desired.

Try this out in [JSFiddle.net](https://jsfiddle.net/gh/get/library/pure/JamesW75/credit-card-autocomplete/tree/main/demo/)
